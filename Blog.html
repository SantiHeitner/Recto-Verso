            <b>Almost There</b>
            <p>Thanks to Noor-Elise Kamaruzzaman and Abigail Chen, the magazine's designers, our 2016-2017 edition is nearly here. It should be complete by the end of the year, just look for us distributing them in the hallways and the cafeteria. Once the edition is out it will also be available on this website so you can enjoy it digitaly. We can't wait to finaly reveal </p><hr>
            <b>Only one edition</b><br>
            <p>Unfortunately, we have not received enough content in these last few months to make an entire edition. What we will do is make one big edition at the end of the school year instead of one in January and one in June. The final edition will be much bigger than any other previous edition, possibly double the normal size. Hopefully the rest of this year can be full of new creativity provided by the wonderful rochambeau community.</p>

            <b>Christmas Break</b><br>
            <p>It is finally christmas break! With half of the year having already flown by, the Recto-Verso team is starting to work on your submissions from 2016. Many texts and drawings have come to our mailboxes as our designers design, editors edit, and illustrators illustrate. A new edition full of the year's creativity is on the horizon!</p>
            <hr>
            <b>Legacy</b><br><br>
            <img src="Recto-Verso/adwinter2016.png" width="60%" />
            <p> We hope you can take inspiration from this edition&#39;s theme&#58; Legacy. Submissions are due December fifth. Expect a new magazine to come out by the end of the winter break!</p>

            <b>The Blog</b>
            <p> You are now looking at the new Recto-Verso blog! This blog will be a way for us to comunicate any important information or any new creations we think you should see ahead of time. You can expect images and writing before they are published as well as updated information on themes or publishing dates. This may be a place where you can take inspiration and turn it into your newest work. This blog will be updated regularly so you can better understand the inner workings of our magazine.</p>

            <b>Beginning of a new year</b><br>
            <p>
                Welcome to a new year at Rochambeau! We are excited for the school year and hope you are too. We hope the year's editions can convey the shining creativity that Rochambeau possesses. The start of a new school year is an opportunity for new begginings. Recto-Verso has done just that by introducing this website to bring Recto-Verso to your computer in an electronic format. We hope you take an initiative and show your imagination by submiting your creations to this student run magazine.</p>
